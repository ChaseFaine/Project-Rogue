# Project-Rogue
This repository includes a Google Drive link in the README file to the download of my small 2D rogue-like video game that I created for my senior project: Project Rogue. Please note that the game is still a work in progress, and the current download file is a playable demo to demonstrate my ability to use Unity and C#.

PLEASE READ -> The game is unfinished and is currently in a playable alpha version. To exit the game, please use ALT+F4.
